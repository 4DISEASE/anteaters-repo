**Period 2 Anteaters - Project Plan**

**College Board “Big Ideas”**

Idea 1 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Summary)</span>



*   The idea of our website is based around a music maker through the use of buttons dedicated to musical notes. The user is prompted to sign into an account which allows them to save their music through databases. The user is then able to click buttons that correspond to musical notes, and are able to customize the instrument. 

Idea 2: 



*   SQLAlchemy database will be used for user logins, and creation of playlists/playback of created music
*   Flask will be used to create back end of website, using routes to link to front end html pages
*   POST/GET methods used for user input
    *   Ties into SQLAlchemy for user logins
*   Search bar will be implemented into our playlist system to filter through songs
*   Search bar will be implemented into song - maker system
    *   Users will be able to save multiple songs, and filter through them using a search system for ease of use

Idea 3:



*   We will create a base website with a temporary design to start with
    *   Website will be changed based on research done
    *   At first, website will be skeleton with a working routing system, and blank spaces to be filled with soundboard and music player/playlist

Idea 4:



*   We will use the last two weeks of the project to portforward with a Raspberry Pi server, and implement HTTP into our project

Idea 5: 



*   We plan to use music/sounds from online sources
    *   Links and proper credit will be used in credit page
*   Night at the museum will be a time for us to showcase our project
